            <h3><a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en">IBM</a></h3>
            <p>The IBM websites main function is to inform what the company does, as well as showoff their products</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C. The website features mostly black text with blue links, and the buttons are blue or white.</li>
                <li>R. The styles for each section are constant, and the same colors, button, and texts styles are used throughout.</li>
                <li>A. Each section has a clearly defined area with the relevent information.</li>
                <li>P. All related items are in the same sections.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Lings Cars</a></h3>
            <p>Lings Cars is a car selling website created by the owner. The website looks like it is from the early 2000's</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C. The contrast of the website is overwhelming in color and in style. There is different styled text all throughout the site, and different colored texts as well. The navigation drop downs are seemingly random colors.</li>
                <li>R. There is some repition, but not much. The most repition on the site is the the side banner that stays constant throughout.</li>
                <li>A. The alignment of the website is medium, it has some sections clearly labled with relevent information but there is a lot os.</li>
                <li>P. The proximitiy of the website is alright, with all the cars bing in the same section.</li>
            </ul>
