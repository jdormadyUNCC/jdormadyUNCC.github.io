        <ul>
            <li>The website leads to the page to be reviewed.</li>
            <li>There are no spaces in the file names.</li>
            <li>Page has consistent font styling throughout the page using a CSS stylesheet.</li>
            <li>The contrast is good, with white text on a dark background, it makes it easy to read.</li>
            <li>Page has good repetition, alignment, and proximity. One thing I noticed is that there is a divider line used on "About Us" and "Meet the Crew" pages but not on any of the other pages.</li>
            <li>Page has head, body, header, main, and footer.</li>
            <li>Overall, the page looks very well-made and organized. Content is arranged neatly and is easy to read from top to bottom. A few things I would suggest would be to make the text color a little darker to help with eye strain. While the white text makes it pop, it could be hard to look at for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>The page's background is cool and fits with the client's theme but might make it hard to focus on the content at times.</li>
            <li>Social media integration is a nice feature, and the page looks clean.</li>
