            <p>Urbanization is one of the leading reasons for habitat degradation. What this means is that the development and construction on land changes environments and often leads to lower quality environments for many organisms. Disturbance can cause significant soil erosion and concrete surfaces are impenetrable by water, causing increase stormwater runoff. Pollution coming from urban areas can also threaten habitats. Car exhaust, sewage, and sediments all generated from urban activities contribute to this. Aquatic ecosystems are especially at risk due to the “River continuum”, a concept that describes rivers as interconnected with the entire watershed and the various aquatic bodies they feed into. Essentially, anything that is put into the stream can impact the surrounding environment and downstream. One way to study changes in water quality and environment quality is to sample for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Within freshwater ecosystems these are mostly insects, worms, snails, and crustaceans but can include any invertebrate that can be seen with the naked eye. They respond relatively quickly to environmental changes compared to other organisms, so their presence or absence within the environment can help determine what kind of pollutants are present. Macroinvertebrate like worms and some fly larvae can exists in extremely poor environments, and others such as mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) generally require cleaner water and are sensitive to changes in water chemistry. They also require specific habitat and conditions that reflect natural stream conditions. By sampling for macroinvertebrates, we can gain insight into how urbanization and pollution is impacting streams and what solutions are available.
