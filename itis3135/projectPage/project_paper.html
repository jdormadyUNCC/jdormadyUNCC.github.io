            <h1>Comparison of Macroinvertebrate Communities between Forested and Urban streams 
            </h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Urbanization has been known to impact watersheds negatively in a number of ways. For streams, this often includes poor water quality and increased sediment concentration. Macroinvertberates respond to these changes and will likely be found where they can tolerate certain levels of environmental stress. Forested streams, being the natural habitat of pollution, temperature, and oxygen sensitive taxa will likely have a community representative of cleaner stream conditions. The study aimed to analyze the macroinvertebrate community for eight stream sites within the Swannanoa River basin and to compare communities between urban and forested sites. We found that urban sites had a higher Family Biotic Index (FBIBI) than forested sites, indicating less than tolerable environmental conditions for common bio-indicators such as Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera families. Research on urban streams suggests that this is the normal pattern, citing sediment pollution and nutrient enrichment to be the top concerns. Conductivity was highest in urban sites downstream and the inverse was true for dissolved oxygen. Scoured banks and incised channels found at urban sites with high conductivity are indicative of increased flow volume and velocity during precipitation events eroding soil. Communities were more diverse within forested sites compared to urban sites. Two sediment tolerant taxa, Chironomidae and Oligochaete, composed most of the community for two urban sites Grassy Branch and Sweeten Creek. Forested sites had higher diversity including abundances of EPT. Higher habitat diversity increases available niches which can lead to higher community diversity, whereas sedimentation can decrease habitat heterogeneity. The differences in community diversity is likely due to the differences in habitat quality.

            <!--Introduction-->
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Anthropogenic activity has been changing and developing the southern Appalachian urbanized streams and floodplains. Urban streams are often in poor shape due to channel modification, increased runoff, and disturbance within the stream and floodplain. This is known as “urban stream syndrome” (Walsh et.al 2005) which includes a flashy hydrograph, increased concentration of sediment, nutrient, and contaminant pollution, altered channel morphology and flow, and a reduction in biodiversity . Loss of riparian vegetation also contributes to water temperature by reducing shade, and can increase algae growth while decreasing the diversity of aquatic organisms (Gardiner et. al). As a result, urban streams are generally warmer and have less capacity to retain dissolved oxygen.</p>
            <p>Aquatic macroinvertebrates represent a large and diverse community within Appalachian freshwater streams. They form the dominant animal communities within headwater streams and contribute to important ecological functions. Many species require specific environmental conditions to thrive, and respond quickly to changes in water quality. Notably, the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera are intolerant to low DO and higher water temperatures which makes them ideal bioindicators for water quality (Weigel et.al 2000).  As urbanization further degrades streams, it is important to study how aquatic ecosystems react to anthropogenic development and pollution.</p>
            <p>The Swannanoa rivershed boasts a large number of small streams across elevation and pollution gradients which feed into the larger French Broad river, of which sections have been put on the 303(d) list under the Clean Water Act  for impaired water quality. While Macroinvertebrate have shown to be effective indicators for water temperature, DO and pollution, there is still much to learn about their response to urbanization and how it impacts water quality  within the Southern Appalachians. By sampling streams around the watershed we can assess the current state of stream water quality and predict how urbanization could impact community structures.</p>
                </p>
            <br>
            <!--Methods-->
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>We sampled from eight streams within the Swannanoa River basin, including four forested and four urban streams. The four forested sites were Burgin Cove, Flat Creek, North Fork and Camp Branch. Flat Creek is located in Montreat, NC and is covered by hardwood shade with shallow water. North Fork is located near a gravel quarry with shade cover, although not completely. Camp Branch was located within a park and was shaded with hardwood cover. The stream was moderately deep with cold fast flowing water. The Urban streams include Bee Tree Creek, Haw Creek, Grassy Branch, and Sweeten Creek. Bee Tree Creek was located next to a church and was a small stream less than 3 feet wide with some sections being about a foot wide. The stream was very shallow in most areas and had little shade cover. Haw Creek was located behind a Lowe’s home improvement store and was filled with trash. The stream had shade cover and the bottom was covered in fine sediment. Grassy Branch was located within a rural area among housing. The banks had collapsed on one side and sewage pipes ran through the stream. Sweeten Creek was located within a heavily urbanized area and surrounded by asphalt. Both banks were heavily incised and the stream was shallow with gravel sediment covering the bottom.</p>
            <p>Two riffles and two pools were selected for each tributary site. For each riffle and each pool, we used a random number generator to determine the exact spot to sample from. We did this twice for each riffle and pool, totaling 8 samples per site. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a surber sampler, where larger stones were scraped into the net and removed from the sites briefly to expose the smaller stones better suited for  sampling. Sites were disturbed thoroughly for 2 minutes making sure to keep the net in front of the sample site. Nets were then filtered through a wire sieve and the samples were placed into jars filled with ethanol and covered. The jars were stored in a dark cool area until ready to sort through. Macroinvertberate were identified using a LICOR dissecting scope and keyed to family.</p> 
            <p>Macroinvertebrate tolerance index values were used to find the FBIBI (Hillsenhoff 1988) for each site. Calculations were done using the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index method, and sample data were grouped together for each stream to find the average FBIBIBI per stream.</p>
            <p>We performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the 8 sites using the sample data to determine if there were significant differences in FBIBI among all sites. This was done in google sheets using the XLminer extension. If a significant difference was found, a T-test was performed to compare the means of each site.</p>
            <br>
            <!--Results-->
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Chironomidae was the most commonly sampled macroinvertebrate, although this differs between sites. Five sites were found to have chironomidae as the most abundant macroinvertebrate with Grassy Branch(58.4%) followed by SBC (50.3%), North Fork (41.9%), CB (36.6%), and Sweeten Creek (27.9%). Hydropyschidae were more abundant comparatively at two sites including Bee Tree (48.1%) and Haw Creek (27.7%). Baetidae were most comparatively abundant at Flat Creek (26.4%). Oligochaetes were also found at every site but notably had high abundance within Grassy Branch (24.9%) and Sweeten Creek (19.4%) (Table 2).</p>
            <p>Overall, Urban sites had higher FBIBI compared to Forested sites (Figure 1). Grassy Branch and Sweeten Creek had FBIBI values calculated at 7.72 and 6.63. Flat creek had the lowest FBIBI at 3.9. Burgin Cove, North Fork, Camp Branch, and Haw Creek were all within a small range (4.75-5.31).The ANOVA found that the means of all 8 sites were significantly different (P=0.004, df=7). Comparing sites revealed Flat Creek(p=0.006), Burgin Cove(p=0.006), North Fork(p=0.03), camp branch(p=0.018), haw creek(p=0.017), and Bee Tree(p=0.044) to have significantly different FBIBI than grassy branch. No sites were significantly different when compared to sweeten creek.
            <p>Flat Creek had both the lowest conductivity (17.19 ms/cm)  and the highest concentration of dissolved oxygen (9.52mg/L). Camp Branch had the second lowest conductivity (32.5ms/cm) and the second highest dissolved oxygen concentration (9.38mg/L). Haw Creek had the highest conductivity (132.9) and the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration (8.29) (Figure 2, table 1)</p>
            <br>
            <!--Discussion-->
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>The forested streams had lower average FBIBI when compared to the four urban streams, indicating lower water quality. The forested streams in the study were found to have a greater ratio of intolerant taxa and are able to support them through high dissolved oxygen concentration, substrate to colonize, and clean water. Urban streams may be less capable due to a variety of factors stemming from bank development and runoff causing erosion and pollution (Walsh 2005) Sediment runoff contributes to higher sedimentation, making environments less suitable for sensitive taxa and reducing their effectiveness as niches. Sediment may also absorb heat faster than water and increase water temperature, stressing aquatic communities.</p>
            <p>Grassy Branch was the most different from all sites, being comparable only to sweeten creek. These two sites also had the highest FBIBI scores among the sites with high abundances of tolerant macroinvertebrate. Oligochaetes and Chironomidae are both highly tolerant of sediment pollution , which is also often a characteristic of urban streams. Because these sites are located further downstream than the forested sites, it might be expected that they would contain more sediment on average compared to other sites.</p> 
            <p>For the urban sites in the study stormwater runoff is likely a large contributor to pollution and exacerbates erosion(Chen 2007, Mallin 2009). The banks feature  little vegetation except within the riparian zone with the surrounding area covered with asphalt and concrete surfaces. This is most likely an issue for urban sites like Sweeten Creek, Grassy Branch . Stormwater runoff into streams is intensified due to impervious surfaces which involves higher hydrocarbons (from fuel exhaust) as well as deposited sediments from vehicles (Chithra 2015). Both sites are located near asphalt areas and had high FBIBI and high conductivity along with sediment tolerant communities, although we did not test for sediment load specifically. This may also contribute to faster, higher volume flows during precipitation events which would erode the bank and increase sediment pollution. Urban streams exhibit symptoms which reflect this condition, notably with the morphology of the bank and the stream. Sweeten Creek has steep deep banks which abruptly drop into the stream, which is shallow during low to normal flow. The morphology could suggest that during high volume flows caused by precipitation, the water moves quickly and overtime erodes the bottom of the stream at a faster rate than it can expand.</p>
            <p>The lowest FBIBI calculation came from Flat Creek at 3.9, with slight deviations. Flat Creek is one of the forested sites in the study being closer to the headwaters. At this site, abundant large rocks cause rapid flowing riffles. Riffles are an important mechanism in adding oxygen to the water as flowing water “folds'' on itself, trapping air as bubbles. In addition, plentiful rocky substrate provides habitat for dissolved oxygen sensitive macroinvertebrates.  This is apparent when comparing FBIBI differences between riffles and pools for this site. Pools  will have a sandy or gravel substrate due to sedimentation as water flow slows hitting banks or exiting riffles. However, riffs can vary; slow water flow or excessive sediment can lead to more sediment within riffles whereas faster moving water can scour sediment.</p>
            <p>Grassy Branch and Sweeten Creek had communities composed of over 50% of sediment tolerant macroinvertebrates. Forested streams such as Flat Creek may consist of taxa with a wide range of tolerance and ecological niches which can also be representative of stream conditions. Low tolerance taxa will not be able to colonize in polluted streams, whereas higher tolerance generalist groups can establish themselves in more environments.</p> 
            <p>Pollution and human activities contribute to homogenization of microhabitats and communities within streams by reducing habitat diversity. In “untouched” streams the river continuum (Vannote et al.1980) exhibits homogeneity at the highest and lowest order, however the stream is very diverse otherwise (Barnum 2017). Within these streams native species were highly successful and population decline came from groups who already had a weak presence. For urban streams, the opposite is true. Human activity in streams damages structures such as the presence of woody debris, rock substrates, and well-defined riffles and pools reducing habitat diversity. Increased pollution also pushes out intolerant taxa, decreasing the diversity of potential colonizers.</p>
            <p>Functional feeding groups for urban sites with high FBIBI reveal that a large portion of the community for Grassy Branch and Sweeten Creek are collector-gatherers. Functional feeding groups imply that the sites are able to provide enough fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) for the two dominant taxa, chironomidae and oligochaetes. Through urban sources and runoff (fecal/nitrogenous, chemical, runoff) allochthonous FPOM input can potentially be both toxic to more intolerant species as well as providing food sources for tolerant groups (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012).</p>
            <p>DO and conductivity were measured once per site with a corresponding measurement within the Swannanoa river directly above the tributaries. The conductivity for urban sites in general was much higher than the corresponding Swannanoa measurements, which could be a result of lower flow volume and higher sediment concentration. Sediment pollution as runoff and erosion could enter the tributaries before flowing out to the Swannanoa, which would be more prevalent in urban streams.</p> 
            <p>These tributaries would also deliver sediment loads to the Swannanoa river, leading to a gradual increase in conductivity along the river downstream. At points corresponding to urban tributaries, the increase in conductivity for the Swannanoa was much higher than those from the upstream forested sites(table 1, figure 2). The difference might be impacted by the amount of erosion. The differences in conductivity between the upstream tributaries and the corresponding Swannanoa site was very little, which could mean that the tributaries do not contain much sediment. The forested sites in general had little human development within the stream and they did not run through heavily urbanized areas. The Urban tributaries on the other hand suffer from bank erosion and potentially increased stormwater runoff as a result of human development around the area.</p>
            <p>Stream chemical concentration is very dynamic and can change significantly through disturbance. DO and conductivity likely undergo changes in response to disturbance and may also fluctuate based on the time of the day, temperature, weather, climate, and flow volume. This study did not take periodic measurements of these variables and instead measurements were taken only once on the same day we installed temperature modules. Having access to this information could reveal more about how urbanization impacts stream diversity and how streams react to disturbance. Specifically it could help determine if runoff or channel and bank erosion has more of an impact on the stream, and how the variables respond to changes in environmental factors.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Forested and urban streams differ in many ways, and by using macroinvertebrates to test for FBIBI as well as environmental variables we have identified some key comparisons. Urban streams in this study likely suffer from increased sediment pollution caused by runoff and erosion. This is evident by Grassy Branch and Sweeten Creek having high FBIBI calculations and high relative abundance of tolerant taxa. Forested sites meanwhile had the lowest FBIBI and highest relative abundance of intolerant taxa and EPT, and community diversity was higher as well.</p>
