        <ul>
            <li>No link on the UNCC webpages to the client project.</li>
            <li>1 image in the images folder has capital letters.</li>
            <li>Page has consistent font styling and uses a CSS sheet.</li>
            <li>Contrast is good; the red background is dark enough to avoid eye strain, and the text is easily readable.</li>
            <li>Page has good alignment and proximity. Content is centered.</li>
            <li>Page has head, body, header, main, and footer.</li>
            <li>On the home page, it is the only page to not have its h2 in a container. The containers for the other pages also stretch all the way horizontally even though there is only one or two words in them.</li>
            <li>On the recent project page, it would be cool to click through each image instead of having them all on the same page.</li>
            <li>Footer has links to Charlotte, GitHub, FCC, Codecademy, and LinkedIn that should probably be removed for the client project.</li>
            <li>Overall, the page's theme is fitting for the client project. The colors are a good choice for the theme, and the content is well-arranged. The pages could benefit from some kind of graphic on the sides, or different-colored left and right margins to help the reader really focus on the content.</li>
